= YANG: Yet Another NBH Generator =

Yang is a tool that allows to create custom NBH files from NB ROM parts.  You can combine all the NB ROM parts and create a single NBH file ready to flash. The NBH files created using yang are not signed with the HTC certificate, so youâ€™ll need a method to bypass signature checking on your device bootloader. This is typically done using methods such as HardSPL, JumpSPL, USPL, SSPL, etc. as published in [http://forum.xda-developers.com xda-developers.com forum].
