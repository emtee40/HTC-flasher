Q1. HTCFlasher version 2.0 was able to flash Hermes 1.x bootloaders.
    Why has this feature been removed?

A1. The Hermes was the first HTC device to use NBH in ROM format, the
    Hermes 1.x SPL was a transition from old NBF to new NBH commands
    and it has already been deprected by HTC. You should seriously
    consider upgrading your SPL to a newer version.


Q2. HTCFlasher version 2.0 was able to flash RAW radio ROM accessing
    the radio bootloader directly. Why has this feature been removed?

A2. Flashing radio code is the most easy way to brick a qualcomm radio
    based device. New non-MFG SPLs do not have 'rtask' support and this
    you should be able to pack your radio in a NBH file and flash it.
    

Q3. HTCFlasher version 2.0 was able to dump NAND using 'rbmc'.
    why has this feature been removed?

A3. The 'rbmc' command is not present on most new SPL versions. And the
    resulting dumped file was not useful to flash again.
