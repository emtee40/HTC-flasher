 Introduction
 ============

 HTCflasher is a free (GPL'd) tool to work with HTC based bootloaders (SPLs).

 Currently a limited set of HTC devices is supported, but the basic set of
 functions to work with every HTC bootloader has been implemented, so adding
 support for new bootloader versions or new devices should be quite easy.

 Use it with CARE. If you don't know what you're doing you can brick your
 device. Keep in mind that future / untested bootloaders can break backward
 compatibility. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.


 Supported devices & bootloader versions
 =======================================

 HTCflasher has been tested on the following devices and SPL versions:

 * HTC Hermes (SuperCID):
 	SPL: 1.04, 1.06, 1.09, 1.11, 2.02
	SSPL: 1.09.ds
	HardSPL: 1.10.Oli, 1.40.Olipro, 2.10.Olipro

 * HTC Trinity (SuperCID):
 	SPL: 1.05 MFG , 1.06, 1.07
	SSPL: 1.07.ds
	HardSPL: 1.20.Olipro

 Can it be used in other devices?

 Probably yes, HTC Breeze & HTC Cavalier will most probably work without any
 modifications, as both devices share the same common base version in Hermes
 and Trinity SPLs, but as I don't have those devices I can't test it. 

 Radio flashing and dumping will most probably work out of the box on other
 devices such as Universal and Magician, but I haven't tested it.

 Your feedback/patches are more than welcome :)


 Supported Operating Systems
 ===========================

 I've only tested it on GNU/Linux x86, people have reported it works on
 GNU/Linux x86_64 and intel-based Mac OSX as well.
 I'm not a good programmer nor a Unix guru, so feel free to send patches if
 you port it to other OS or platform.


 HTCflasher features
 ===================

    * Flash NBH files: replaces the usual Windows Rom Upgrade Utility
    * Flash raw (*.nb) radio rom: needs SPL with 'rtask' command
    * Dump radio rom: needs SPL with 'rtask' command  
    * Dump NAND (rbmc): needs SuperCID or hacked SPL
    * Serial prompt: replaces mtty / minicom
